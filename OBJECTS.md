## GameObjects and Collidables

### GameObjects
KjelliGameEngine comes with a GameObject interface, and AbstractGameObject class. For every gameobject you would need to implement in your game,
for the players, enemies, static walls, tiles etc., extend the AbstractGameObject and override the methods required.
